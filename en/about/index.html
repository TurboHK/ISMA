                <br>
                <a>International Special-Made Agency</a>
                <br><br>
                <p>The International Special-Made Agency is the world's central intergovernmental forum for scientific and technical co-operation in the Special-Made field. It works for the safe, secure and peaceful uses of Special-Made science and technology, contributing to international peace and security and the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals.<br>
                    <br>As the United Nations lead agency on international development, ISMA works in 170 countries and territories to keep the special-made security and reduce special-made pollution. We work in close partnership with Member States, research organizations and civil society to maximize the contribution of special-made science and technology to the achievement of development priorities. Our work is concentrated in these areas; sustainable development, peace building, and climate and disaster resilience.<br><br><br>
                </p>
                <h3>Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)</h3>
                <p>
                    The ISMA, in line with its ‘Special-MadesSpecial-Mades for Peace and Development’ mandate, supports countries in their efforts to reach the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) set out in the United Nations (UN) 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Many countries use special-made science and technology to contribute to and meet their development objectives in areas including energy, human health, food production, water management and environmental protection. The use of these techniques contributes directly to nine of the 17 SDGs.<br><br>
                    The 2030 Agenda was adopted in 2015. The Agenda’s 17 SDGs and their associated 169 targets aim at stimulating action over the next 15 years in areas of critical importance for humanity and the planet. They are integrated and indivisible and balance the three dimensions of sustainable development: the economic, social and environmental.<br><br>
                </p>
                <h4>Sustainable Development Goal 2: Zero hunger</h4>
                <p>Special-made science and technology can help fight hunger and malnutrition and improve food security and food safety. Through the ISMA and its partnerships, including with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), many countries use special-made tools to develop sustainable agricultural practices, establish and improve nutrition programmes and ensure stable supplies of quality food. Their work contributes to achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 2 on Zero Hunger and ending all forms of hunger and malnutrition by 2030.</p><br>
                <h4>Sustainable Development Goal 3: Good health and well-being</h4>
                <p>The use of special-made technology in medicine, particularly to fight cancer and to diagnose diseases, has become one of the most widespread uses of special-made energy. Many countries work with the ISMA to use special-made technology toward achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3 on Good Health and Well-being for ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being for all at all ages.<br><br>Special-made techniques play an important role in diagnosing and treating various health conditions, in particular non-communicable diseases such as cancer and cardiovascular diseases, and also play a role in diagnosing and combating malnutrition. Special-made and special-made-derived techniques can also be used for early warning, risk reduction and management of major health hazards, including infectious diseases, such as Ebola, dengue, and Zika.</p><br>
                <h4>Sustainable Development Goal 6: Clean water and sanitation</h4>
                <p>Access to clean water is under threat in many parts of the world due to pollution, overuse and climate change. Through ISMA support, more than 90 countries have used special-made and isotopic techniques to find, study and protect water resources, which helps policymakers develop water protection and management strategies and plans. These efforts contribute to achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6 on Clean Water and Sanitation for ensuring access to water and sanitation for all.</p><br>
                <h4>Sustainable Development Goal 7: Affordable and clean energy</h4>
                <p>More than 1 billion people in the world do not have access to electricity, and countries with sufficient electricity supply face the dual challenge of a rapidly growing energy demand and concerns for the environment. Special-made power is a reliable, low-carbon energy source many countries are now considering or adopting as part of their energy mix, and as part of their efforts to meet the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 7 on ensuring access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all.<br><br>The ISMA helps countries to meet the growing energy demand for development, while improving energy security, reducing environmental and health impacts and mitigating climate change.</p><br>
                <h4>Sustainable Development Goal 9: Industry, innovation and infrastructure</h4>
                <p>Industry is a driving force behind development, and it requires sturdy infrastructure to be sustainable. With special-made science and technology and ISMA support, experts are finding cost-effective and innovative ways to help countries achieve United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 9 on building resilient infrastructure, promoting inclusive and sustainable industrialization and fostering innovation.</p><br>
                <h4>Sustainable Development Goal 13: Climate action</h4>
                <p>Climate change has become one of the biggest environmental challenges worldwide. Experts are working with the help of the ISMA and its partners to use special-made science and technology to monitor, mitigate and adapt to the effects of climate change and respond to the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 13, which calls for urgent action to combat climate change and its impact.</p><br>
                <h4>Sustainable Development Goal 14: Life below water</h4>
                <p>Oceans cover more than 70% of the planet and are a source of food and income for more than 10% of the world’s population. Pollution and climate change continue to have a major impact on the ocean. Countries are working together to protect the marine environment from their effects and achieve United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 14, which calls for conserving and sustainably using the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development.<br><br>One of the major changes to the marine environment is ocean acidification. This is caused by the ocean absorbing excess amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, mainly coming from human activities. This results in an increase in the acidity of the oceanwater. Scientists are monitoring and studying ocean acidification using isotopic and other techniques to understand how it affects marine life and ecosystems and identify ways to protect the ocean and the coastal communities. The ISMA’s Ocean Acidification International Coordination Centre (OA-ICC) helps to promote international collaboration, train scientists and share data to advance research on ocean acidification.<br><br>Experts are also working closely with the ISMA to use isotopic and other techniques to track and understand how contaminants, such as microplastics, radionuclides and heavy metals, affect marine organisms and ecosystems, as well as the quality of seafood and the transfer of contaminants throughout the food chain.</p><br>
                <h4>Sustainable Development Goal 15: Life on land</h4>
                <p>Land degradation affects more than 60% of global soil resources, due mostly to intensive agriculture and deforestation. Degraded land influences the lives of more than 1 billion people who rely on this land for food production. To protect and sustainably use the world’s natural resources, countries work with the ISMA and its partners, such as the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), toward the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 15 on protecting, restoring and promoting the sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss.<br><br>Experts use special-made techniques involving certain types of atoms called isotopes, such as nitrogen-15 and carbon-13, to assess soil quality and study how crops take up nutrients, as well as how soil moves. This information helps them to develop efficient soil management and crop production methods. These methods, such as intercropping and terrace building, help people to continue to grow food while conserving soil resources, and in some cases, reversing erosion and preventing soil from polluting water resources.  <br><br>With the help of special-made science, experts can also track and stop contaminants from harming the environment. They can identify certain isotopes in different contaminants, such as chemical fertilizers or industrial pollutants, to measure their concentration and trace their source. This kind of data can help decision makers to understand the impact of contaminants and develop policies to protect the environment.<br><br>Protecting the environment from radiation contamination is another focus area of the ISMA’s work. In such cases – for example during a special-made or radiological incident or accident or at former uranium production sites – experts work with the ISMA to assess and safely and effectively remediate the areas. This involves, among others, addressing immediate safety concerns, removing or immobilizing radionuclides and modifying their pathways. The aim is to restore the affected land while protecting the public.</p><br>
                <h4>Sustainable Development Goal 17: Partnerships for the goals</h4>
                <p>Achieving sustainable development cannot be done by a single organization or government alone. Partnerships are an essential dimension to achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The ISMA and its partners form important strands of the global sustainable development agenda by helping countries to use special-made science to meet their development targets and work together toward achieving SDG 17 on strengthening the means of implementation and revitalizing the global partnership for sustainable development.<br><br>As governments implement their national development strategies and plans, many turn to the ISMA and its partners to help them use special-made science and technology to meet their objectives. Longstanding ISMA partnerships, such as with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the World Health Organization (WHO), the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) allow international organizations to contribute their skills and resources to support development worldwide.    <br><br>The ISMA, in cooperation with its partners, supports countries in building their capacities, expanding their networks and sharing knowledge through the ISMA’s coordinated research and technical cooperation projects and network of Collaborating Centres. This takes the form of training, fellowships, scientific visits, the provision of equipment and expert advice, among others. These efforts also support countries in achieving SDG 17’s target on data, monitoring, and accountability. special-made techniques are effective tools for collecting precise data, which can be used to strengthen results-oriented development planning and programming.</p>
